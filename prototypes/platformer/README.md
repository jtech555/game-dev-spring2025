# Platformer - Prototype 1

## What were you experimenting with your prototype?

With this prototype I was experimenting with creating a platformer that could implement as many features from the "Platformer Notes" List as I could; as well as provide playtesters with a good "Game Feel". 


## What did you learn from your prototype?

From this prototype I learned how to implement into a platformer:

- Constant Jump Height
- Collecting Stuff
  -- Hidden Collectibles
  -- Enemy Drops Item
- Shooting
  -- Charged Attack
- Manual Camera Controls
  -- Moving the camera without moving the player in order to see more of the level
- Diagonal Platformers
- Time Limit
- Controlling Position in Air
- Double Jump
- Ground Pound
- Health
- Going Through Water Feeling Different
- Lives
- Swimming
- Climbing Ladders
- Wall Climbing / Sticking / Jumping
- Bosses
- I-frames
- Falling Platforms

In addition, I also learned how to:
- Create Intro Scenes and Ending Scenes with pictures and videos
- Add 3D Game Models into Unity, as well as how to activate animations attached to Game Models from sketchfab.com
- Apply lighting to specific areas
- Create Game Boundary Walls that a player can not cross / go past

## Did you learn anything from your playtesters in class? What?

In class I learned from my playtesters that:

- This prototype had a great "Game Feel" as I recieved a round of applause from playtesters, as well as a compliment from Playtester Nathan stating "This game could be used as an entry submission into a Masters Program for Game Design". 

- This prototype had "Tank Controlls" - a terminology I was not familiar with - that was requested to be removed by my Proffesor, to increase Game Feel. In addition taking feedback from my Proffesor, I was also requested to also condence the Player Controls into fewer buttons. 

- How to "Scale with Screen Size" the Intro Scene Images I had in this prototype

# Platformer - Final

## What were you experimenting with your prototype?

With this prototype I was experimenting with removing Tank Controlls, condencing Player Controls into fewer buttons, as well as looked into other Game Features outside of my awareness that I could also implement as a challenge. The additional Game Features I looked into were Fog and "Visually Seen" Wind, inspired while observing my friends live-stream the survival sandbox game Valheim. Images of both shown below:

I knew that both of these Game Features would not only increase the perception of Simulated Space by being a form of Enviromental Polish, but also increase Game Feel.

## What did you learn from your prototype?

From this prototype, I learned that by removing "Tank Controls" and having the camera now follow the player from behind, posed new problems:

-The numpad keys that moved the camera in my first prototype had to be deactivated, as the camera was now following the player
-The player now could observe additional space in the Game Enviroment, instead of one Z axis position - the player could observer the entire 3D enviroment, causing me to have to build upon the Game Enviroment adding additional 3D objects. 

From this prototype I also learned that by creating "Fog" in Unity, is not very difficult at all to implement in a Game, and in fact can be done under a Minute by:
- Clicking on the "Window" Toolbar Option in Unity
- Click "Rendering"
- Click the "Lighting" Option
- Then you will be prompted with a New "Lighting" Window. You will then have to click the "Enviroment" Button.
- Scroll to where it says "Other Settings"
- Check the "Fog" Box
However, upon adding Fog to my prototype, I realised that this posed an additional problem as well - I could not clearly see game objects that were in the distance that I added - other islands added, as well as a moon etc. Since I could not find out a way to make the additional game objects to not be affected by fog, I made the choice to remove fog implementation from my prototype.

From this prototype I also learned how to add a "Particle System" effect - creating a visual represention of a volcano errupting with 2 sepreate "Particle System" Game Objects using the colors red and yellow, as can be seen in top right hand corner below:

## Did you learn anything from your playtesters in class? What?

I was unfortunatly not present in class to have my game be playtested. However the following class presenting my game, viewers appeared to be happy with the end result.
